README

A simple "remote control" for Music.app which demonstrates how to call AppleScript via the AppleScript-ObjC (ASOC) bridge within a Swift-Cocoa app. 

Caution: The AppleScript code lacks detailed error reporting and the Swift code's error handling is minimal. The app will fail *silently* if the following requirements are not met:

- The Plist.info file must contain an "NSAppleEventsUsageDescription" entry.

- If Hardened Runtime is enabled, the Apple Events exception in Targets > Signing & Capabilities must be selected.

- If sandboxing is enabled, the appropriate "com.apple.Music.library..." entitlements must be declared.

- The user grants the app Authorization to control Music.app when first prompted by macOS.

This code is released into the public domain.
