README

Demonstrates how to call AppleScript via the AppleScript-ObjC framework (ASOC) in a Swift-Cocoa app.

Modified for macOS 10.15+, which renamed iTunes to Music.


Caution: The AppleScript performs minimal error checking so the app will fail silently if the following requirements are not met:

- The Plist.info file must contain an "NSAppleEventsUsageDescription" entry.

- If Hardened Runtime is enabled, the Apple Events exception in Targets > Signing & Capabilities must be selected.

- If sandboxing is enabled, the appropriate "com.apple.Music.library..." entitlements must be declared.

- The user grants the app Authorization to control Music.app when first prompted by macOS.
